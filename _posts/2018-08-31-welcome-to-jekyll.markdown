Introduction Post for YC.

To anyone who is interested,

I am the founder of chainlinks, which is building an authentication protocol and standard for blockchain wallets, exchanges, and platforms to adopt. A high level explanation of our product is that that we want to make it as simple as clicking on 'Login with Facebook' to access your cryptocurrency wallets while maintain the same safety and security that are present and in place today.

Our goal is really to try and bring all blockchain technologies together in order to simplify the entry into the space for the general public

For the more technical, were building a sort of OAuth, mixed with PCI-compliance for the blockchain community. This solves:

- One login and authentication method for all platforms
- Single repository for documents needed in verifying identities (National ID, Passports)
- Know Your Customer (KYC)
- Comply with complicated financial regulations
- Reduce account fraud
- Security (No need for multiple passwords and avoid lost private keys)

We're still early in development, but hope to have a working MVC/alpha within the next 8 weeks, and maybe a beta by the end of the course.

Some background on myself for the curious, this is my third startup, and I would say that I have decent experience in fintech for someone my age. I've grown and learned so much since my first startup, where I made the decision to drop out of college to pursue my first company with a group of friends of mine. We went out with ambitious goals to restructure the [broken] electronic payment network by building a payment delivery network, similar to a content delivery network (CDN) for images, and although it was an amazing idea, the implementation and adoption from larger companies was much harder than we expected. 

This is where I fell in love with challenges and opportunities that Silicon Valley could bring, and how I found myself today, trying to build something new and innovative again.
