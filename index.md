Hello.

As founder I have developed a distributed authentication method for financial services in the blockchain community for use by wallets, exchanges, and various other platforms. 

Our protocol was developed using the OAuth and FIDO standard to create a single user profile that connects universally. An API has been developed for use by developers of other companies. Chainlinks aims to be the standard for user authentication, identification, and verification by hosting users accounts and profiles under one service.

The company is currently enrolled in and advised by YCombinators Startup School.
